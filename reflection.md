# What we learned
- The ultrasonic sensor can sense things on the side (peripheral vision)
- If a motor can't complete an action, the code doesn't move on from that one action
- How to use bevel gears to turn things at right angles
- How to make paper spiders
- Code executes linearly
# What worked well
- The dispenser worked consistently
- Interesting design/theme
- Placement of button in relation to hand
- Pretty well built for cardboard and tape
# What we would do differently
- Use better materials
- 3D print dispenser parts to make more symmetrical
- Make hand reset itself
- Make button easier to press
- Amplify sound
